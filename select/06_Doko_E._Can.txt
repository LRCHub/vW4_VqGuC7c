[Translated from Japanese]

Those filthy bloody factories in Tokyo,
It's just a polluted city.
Where can we go?
Discover Japan!
The pollution is making it more and more shitty.
For God's sake, let's get away.
But where can we escape to?
This cold, filty, polluted city!
It's become so foul that
Even the trees have withered away.
What's happened to them?
Clean people, clean rice,
Clean homes, clean earth, no chance.
Let's try eat fresh vegetables, but stop eating the fish.
Why?
